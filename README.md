## Introduction

The Water Billing System is designed to assist users in calculating their monthly water bills based on their usage type (Residential, Commercial, or Industrial) and monthly consumption.

## Usage Types

1. **Residential (Code: 1)**
2. **Commercial (Code: 2)**
3. **Industrial (Code: 3)**

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Select your usage type by entering the corresponding code.
3. Enter your monthly consumption in cubic centimeters (cm^3).
4. View your calculated monthly water bill.

## Billing Algorithms

The system uses different billing algorithms based on the type of usage:

- **Residential:**
  - Monthly Water Bill = Monthly Consumption * 25.00 KES/cm^3

- **Commercial:**
  - Monthly Water Bill = Monthly Consumption * 30.50 KES/cm^3

- **Industrial:**
  - Monthly Water Bill = Monthly Consumption * 35.75 KES/cm^3

## Examples

**1. Residential Usage:**
```plaintext
Enter your code: 1
Enter your monthly consumption: 200
Your monthly water bill is: 200 cm^3 * 25.00 = 5000 KES
```

**2. Commercial Usage:**
```plaintext
Enter your code: 2
Enter your monthly consumption: 300
Your monthly water bill is: 300 cm^3 * 30.50 = 9150 KES
```

**3. Industrial Usage:**
```plaintext
Enter your code: 3
Enter your monthly consumption: 500
Your monthly water bill is: 500 cm^3 * 35.75 = 17875 KES
```
